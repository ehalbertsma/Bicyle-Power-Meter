Bicycle Power Meter on an ESP32 board. 

Right now the file is able to send a power reading to a BLE head unit, which increments at specified interval.

Next steps: 
- Implement low pass filter.
- Get input from strain gauge.
- Compute force from change in V/R.
- Compute power from force and velocity.
- Calibration.
